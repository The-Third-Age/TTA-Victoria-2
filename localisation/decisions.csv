##### GONDOR DECISIONS #####;x {
############################;x
annex_lossarnach_title;Royal Acquisition of Lossarnach;x
annex_lossarnach_desc;To fight the coming §MShadow§!, our feudal kingdom needs to centralize. We will start with our closest substate: §GLossarnach§!.;x
annex_lebennin_title;Restructure Eastern Territories;x
annex_lebennin_desc;After our annexation of Lossarnach, our next focus is the Eastern half of our realm. The lands of §GLebennin§! are close enough that we can centralize it to royal authority. Despite the rest of "Central Gondor" being beyond any reasonable reach of our centralization for the moment, that does not mean that we cannot restructure it.;x
tolfalas_question_title;The Tolfalas Question;x
tolfalas_question_desc;In addition to the Eastern half of Gondor, there is the question of the Isle of Tolfalas.;x
da_independence_war_title;The Tolfalas Insult;x
da_independence_war_desc;Our overlords in Minas Tirith have chosen to ignore our claims to the Isle of Tolfalas. While they may think that that was the right choice for the §MRealm of Gondor§!, we will proove them wrong...\n\n§BThis decision will start an independence war. §RIf you lose, you will be annexed.§!;x
annex_lamedon_title;Integrate Lamedon;x
annex_lamedon_desc;Our centralization policies have become strong enough to allow us to easily integrate §GLamedon§! under royal authority.;x
annex_anfalas_title;Incorporate Anfalas;x
annex_anfalas_desc;With the newest edicts out of $CAPITAL$, it has been declared that much of Anfalas is rightfully owned by the $MONARCHTITLE$. As such, we can now more easily centralize Anfalas.;x
annex_dol_amroth_title;The End of a Princedom;x
annex_dol_amroth_desc;The §GPrincipality of Dol Amroth§!, formally created in the most modern sense in T.A 2044, has been a substate of our kingdom for the almost entirety of its existence. After many meetings and intense discussion, it has finally been decided that the Principality will be no more; it will fall under royal authority as all the rest of the fiefdoms.;x
houses_of_healing_title;Houses of Healing;x
houses_of_healing_desc;The houses of healing of Minas Tirith as famed in the realm for their ability to heal the sick and wounded - they have saved countless lives of our soldiers.;x
